Smart Air Monitoring System
With the advent of technology, more and more
aspects of our lives are being digitized. Hence, eventually, there
will be a need for sensor-based networks for creating sustainable
living conditions. This paper aims to describe the implementation
and application of an Air Quality monitoring and analysis
network(AQMAN) capable of monitoring different air quality
parameters which could then be used to predict the sustainability
of a locality at the expense of precision. The network employs
various Machine Learning algorithms for forecasting the parameters on multiple time granularity. A method for constructing a
Geospatial graph of the parameterâ€™s concentration has also been
discussed in the later sections. The paper takes a more pragmatic
approach of making the system cheaper, reliable, scalable and
accessible.
